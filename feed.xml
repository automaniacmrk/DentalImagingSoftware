                <h2>What is Dental Imaging?</h2>
<p>Care providers can't get an accurate picture of the patient's oral health without performing an oral exam. Dr. Dentists need to be able see any troubling conditions, including hidden decay or extra teeth. They also have to know if the patient is experiencing bone loss due gum disease.</p>
<p>That's where imaging technology comes in. It allows professionals to get more clear and comprehensive pictures of teeth, tissue, nerves and bone inside the mouth. These images can then be studied, stored and compared over time to track improvements or identify worsening conditions.</p>

<p>Because dentists can detect problems early, dental imaging helps them to make more precise diagnoses. They can also share images with patients and point out specific problems. This allows them to educate their patients better.</p>

<p>Good imaging software can make a big difference when it comes to a dental practice's profitability. Since most dentists need to see a certain number of patients per day to cover costs, it's important for their workflow to be as efficient as possible. Unfortunately, clunky or outdated imaging software is often a barrier to achieving peak productivity, because it requires you to spend more time figuring out the system's kinks than analyzing your patient's images.</p>
<p>Whether you're looking to replace an existing dental imaging solution, or you're seeking software for a new practice, we're here to help you make a smart purchase decision to keep operations running smoothly.

<h2>Digital Dental Imaging Software Explained</h2>
<p>In the past, dentists' offices had film-based radiography equipment that required a darkroom to process images. With the dawn of digital dental imaging tools (and their accompanying software systems), many providers have realized the old method is a time-consuming and ineffective way to use practice resources.</p>
<p>Digital imaging practices don't require a darkroom. They can use sensors, pans or intraoral cameras instead. There's no need for chemical processing, as the images from these devices are immediately generated and accessible via computer.</p>
<p>Here are some of the advantages of digital imaging as described by a study published in the Journal of the American Dental Association (JADA):</p>
<ul>
<li>Immediate image production</li>
<li>Display on interactive monitor with ability to magnify image details and take direct measurements</li>
<li>Perfect radiographic duplicates for referral purposes</li>
<li>Security mechanisms to identify original images and differentiate them from altered images</li>
<li>The ability to tag information such as a patient identifier, date of exposure and other relevant details</li>
</ul>
<p>These benefits are being embraced by many practices. In a Software Advice report of dental software buyer trends, we discovered the greatest amount of dental professionals (18 percent) specifically cite imaging device and/or digital sensor integration as their top-requested software functionality.</p>

<h2>What is Dental Imaging?</h2>
<p>Care providers can't get an accurate picture of the patient's oral health without performing an oral exam. Dentists must be able to see if there are any worrisome conditions that are obstructed from their view, such as hidden tooth decay, impacted/extra teeth, bone loss from gum disease and/or the growth of any abscesses, cysts or tumors.</p>
<p>Imaging technology is the solution. This technology allows professional to take clearer and more detailed pictures of the teeth, tissues, nerves, and bones inside the mouth. These images can then be studied, stored and compared over time to track improvements or identify worsening conditions.</p>

<p>Dental imaging is necessary because it gives dentists a better chance of detecting problem areas early for more accurate diagnoses. It also allows them to better educate patients because they can share the images, point to specific areas of concern and show why it's important to adhere to treatment recommendations.</p>

<h2>What'S So Great About Rounded Corners?</h2>
<p>Every digital sensor design has to balance between field of view and patient comfort. Increasing the field of view can be achieved by increasing the size of the sensor. A larger sensor can produce more diagnostic information but it is more difficult for patients to use.</p>
<p>Round corners maximize this compromise by decreasing the patient pinch where it hurts, while still improving the field of vision. Sensors with only one or two rounded corners are less comfortable than sensors with four corners.</p>
