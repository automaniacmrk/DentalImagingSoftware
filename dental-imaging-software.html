Dentists must be able to see if there are any worrisome conditions that are obstructed from their view, such as hidden tooth decay, impacted/extra teeth, bone loss from gum disease and/or the growth of any abscesses, cysts or tumors.</p><p><a href="https://maxidentsoftware.com/digital-imaging/">Dental Imaging technology</a> is the solution. This technology allows professional to take clearer and more detailed pictures of the teeth, tissues, nerves, and bones inside the mouth. These images can then be studied, stored and compared over time to track improvements or identify worsening conditions.</p><p>An X-ray image viewed on Maxident software</p><p>Dental imaging is necessary because it gives dentists a better chance of detecting problem areas early for more accurate diagnoses. It also allows them to better educate patients because they can share the images, point to specific areas of concern and show why it's important to adhere to treatment recommendations.</p><h2>Digital Dental Imaging Explained</h2><p>In the past, dentists' offices had film-based radiography equipment that required a darkroom to process images. With the dawn of digital dental imaging tools (and their accompanying software systems), many providers have realized the old method is a time-consuming and ineffective way to use practice resources.</p><p>Digital imaging practices don't require a darkroom. They can use sensors, pans or intraoral cameras instead. These images can be generated instantly and accessed via the computer without any chemical processing.</p><p>Here are some of the advantages of digital imaging as described by a study published in the Journal of the American Dental Association (JADA):</p><ul><li>Instant image production</li><li>Interactive monitor display with the ability to enhance image features and make direct measurements</li><li>Perfect radiographic duplicates for referral purposes</li><li>Security mechanisms to identify original images and differentiate them from altered images</li><li>Ability to tag data such as patient identification, date of exposure or other pertinent details</li></ul><p>These benefits are being embraced by many practices. In a Software Advice report of dental software buyer trends, we discovered the greatest amount of dental professionals (18 percent) specifically cite imaging device and/or digital sensor integration as their top-requested software functionality.</p><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://www.midmark.com/images/default-source/products/dental/imaging/imaging-software/progeny-imaging/progeny-imaging.jpg?sfvrsn=71223845_2" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Dental Imaging Software" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>What'S So Great About Rounded Corners?</h2><p>Every digital sensor design has to balance between field of view and patient comfort. Increasing the field of view can be achieved by increasing the size of the sensor. A larger sensor can produce more diagnostic information but it is more difficult for patients to use.</p><p>Round corners maximize this compromise by decreasing the patient pinch where it hurts, while still improving the field of vision. Sensors with only one or two rounded corners are less comfortable than sensors with four corners.</p><p>Have a look at the Eva Select Dental Sensor System</p><h2>Power Function</h2><ul><li>Single Click Capture from specific devices</li><li>Customizable Layouts/Mounts for Bitewings, FMX, etc.</li><li>You can select multiple images to compare/review</li><li>Easy and powerful annotation tools</li><li>Measuring tool for manual or auto calibration</li><li>Extremely easy to adjust brightness, contrast and gamma</li><li>The Customizable image Contrast Enhancement function (ICE) allows you to adjust filters that enhance images in various ways.</li><li>Powerful Device Image Quality (IQ) default settings</li><li>Import/Export of images</li></ul><h2><img loading="lazy" src="https://orthodonticproductsonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/CarestreamDental_CS-Airway-1280x640.jpg" data-is-external-image="true" alt="Dental Imaging Software" width="80%" height="auto"></h2><h2>Expertise To Help You Optimize For Your Needs</h2><p>Our company has been doing dental imaging for over three decades (our company used to be Dent-x), and we have helped thousands of dental offices make the most of their imaging systems.
